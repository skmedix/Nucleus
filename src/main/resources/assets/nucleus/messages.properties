+------------------------------------------------------------+

config.chat.modify=If "true", Nucleus will attempt to modify the chat
config.chat.template.namecolour=The default colour for a player''s name if the "namecolour" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes the same input as the "chatcolour" option \
set to "" to retain default behaviour (no change of colour). Do not include the "&" character.
config.chat.template.namestyle=The default styles for a player''s name if the "namestyle" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes \
  the same input as the "namestyle" option, set to "" to retain default behaviour (no style). Do not include the "&" character. Multiple styles \
  must be separated by commas.
config.chat.template.chatcolour=The default colour for a player''s chat if the "chatcolour" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes the same input as the "namecolour" option \
set to "" to retain default behaviour (no change of colour). Do not include the "&" character.
config.chat.template.chatstyle=The default styles for a player''s chat if the "chatstyle" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes the same input as the "chatstyle" option \
set to "" to retain default behaviour (no style). Do not include the "&" character. Multiple styles must be separated by commas.
config.chat.template.prefix='Sets the prefix to a message. {{prefix}} - prefix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{suffix}} - suffix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{name}} - real name, {{displayname}} - display name'
config.chat.template.suffix='Sets the suffix to a message. {{prefix}} - prefix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{suffix}} - suffix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{name}} - real name, {{displayname}} - display name'
config.chat.default-template=The default chat template if no group templates apply.
config.chat.group-templates=Group templates override the default chat template based on the users group. Note that the group name is case sensitive.\n\
Weight matters, the player will use the highest weighted template in this list that matches a group they are in, including inherited groups. If the same weight \
is used on two or more entries, the group with the most parents will be used.
config.chat.weight=The weight of the template. A higher number will take priority over lower numbers when two templates could apply to the same player because \
they are in the both groups.
config.chat.useGroupTemplates=If "true", then Nucleus will select the most appropriate group template for a player when they send a chat message. If it''s false \n\
the default template will always be used, but there will be a performance gain because a player''s groups not not have to be retrieved from the permission plugin. \n\
Turn this off if you are getting severe performance problems when someone chats, it''s usually due to a misbehaving permissions plugin.
config.chat.check-permission-groups=If true, Nucleus will select the most appropriate group template for a player when they send a chat message by \
  checking all of the groups that a player has if the player does not have the "nucleus.chat.group" permission option set. If false, Nucleus will \
  only look for the "nucleus.chat.group" option on players when they chat and will match that to the available group templates, if no match, \
  Nucleus will apply the default template without checking actual permission groups. \n\n\
  If your chat is lagging and you have group templates turned on, try setting this to false and giving your groups the appropriate \
  "nucleus.chat.group" permission option.
config.chat.main=If true, Nucleus will take the message and try to apply it''s own transforms to it. This may overwrite other plugins who do processing super early, so turn this off if you are having problems.
config.chat.includeprefix=If false, Nucleus will prepend it''s prefixes/headers with those already set buy other plugins. If true, it will \
  overwrite them.
config.chat.includesuffix=If false, Nucleus will prepend it''s suffixes/footers with those already set buy other plugins. If true, it will \
  overwrite them.
config.chat.meprefix=The prefix to use when someone uses "/me".
config.chat.checkbody=Some mods and plugins move the Minecraft player prefix to the main message body. If this is the case, turn this on, and Nucleus \n\
  will try to remove it.

config.environment.maxweathertime=The maximum amount of time that the weather can be set to last, in seconds. Set to -1 for no restriction.

config.connection.reservedslots=The maximum number of reserved slots that can be used. Set to -1 for unlimited.

  "nucleus.afk.exempt.kick".\n\n\
  Note that this is not time since going AFK, but time since last activity. Setting this to the same value as "afktime" will cause someone who goes\
   AFK to be kicked instantly.
config.afk.whenvanished=If true, the server will announce when players go AFK, even when vanished. If false, only non-vanished players can go AFK.
config.afk.oncommandsend=If true, any player that tries to use a command that might require the target to do something will be told if the target is AFK.

config.afk.playerkicked=The message sent to a player when kicked for inactivity.
config.afk.messagetobroadcastonkick=If empty, no message will be sent.

config.nicknames.prefix=A prefix to any nickname that is displayed in chat.
config.nicknames.pattern=A regular expression that limits what form the nickname can take. If Nucleus fails to read the regex here, the default of "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+" \
(the same restriction as Minecraft usernames) will be used. To allow all characters, use ".+".

config.home.safeTeleport=If true, Nucleus will attempt to ensure that users do not get warped into an unsafe situation (for example, if someone breaks blocks around a home).
config.home.respawnAtHome=If true, on respawn, a player will spawn back at their default home (named "home") if it exists.

  This supports both world names and world UUIDs.

config.spawn.forcefirstspawn=If true, then Nucleus will attempt to force players joining for the first time to spawn at the *direct point* that first spawn has been set.\n\
  Only set this if you want Nucleus to override all other plugins on first spawn.

config.fly.stateonquit=If true, if a player is flying when they disconnect, this state is remembered. If false, this information is only retained between player disconnects if /fly was used.
config.fly.permissiononlogin=If true, in order to keep fly state on login, the permission for the fly command (nucleus.fly.base) is required. If false, a player without access to the \
  /fly command will fall to the ground on login if they are in the air.

config.rtp.min-y=The minimum Y value that can be teleported to.
config.rtp.max-y=The maximum Y value that can be teleported to.
config.rtp.perworldperms=If true, Nucleus will check the permission "nucleus.rtp.worlds.<worldname>" (where worldname is in lower case) before \
allowing an RTP attempt to go through.
config.rtp.perworldsect=If a world is listed below with a valid config section, it will take precedence over the global section. World names should \
be lower case (so, standard nether should be "dim-1".\n\nCopy the example block and paste it below, with the correct world name, to set the \
per-world options.
config.rtp.defaultworld=If this is set, and the world name here matches one of your worlds (case-sensitive!), then `/rtp` will default to use the \
world specified here. Otherwise, the player''s current world will be used.
config.rtp.prohibitedbiomes=A list of biomes that RTP should not attempt to teleport into.
config.rtp.defaultmethod=The default RTP kernel to use with /rtp. The default options are:\n\n\
  * "nucleus:default": standard RTP, with the min/max radius centred around the spawn point\n\
  * "nucleus:surface_only": RTP which will attempt to only pick a surface (must see sky) location, with the min/max radius centred around the spawn \
  point\n\
  * "nucleus:around_player": RTP which is like default, but the random position will depend on the player''s current position, not the spawn point\n\
  * "nucleus:around_player_surface": RTP which is like surface only, but the random position will depend on the player''s current position, not the \
  spawn point\n\n\
  Other plugins might add their own kernels, in which case they will give you an ID to use here.

config.core.accurate=When trying to calculate the number of visitors, having this enabled will include visitors before Nucleus was installed, but \
  may cause incompatibilities with other plugins that do not register data keys during startup. For compatibility, this should be false, for \
  accuracy, this can be true.
config.core.warmup.info=If true, cancel a user''s warmup on...
config.core.warmup.move=movement
config.core.warmup.command=running a command
config.core.commandonname='If set, this command will be suggested if a player clicks on the user name in chat in templated messages. Use {{player}} to indicate the player name.'
config.core.kickonstop.flag=If true, Nucleus will kick all users just prior to the server stopping.
config.core.kickonstop.message=The message to display to players when restarting the server. Overridden when using the /stop [reason] command.
config.core.safeteleport=These parameters define how far out to check from a specific point when performing a warp. Larger numbers mean that a wider area is checked, \
but large numbers will cause server lag. The defaults are sufficient in most cases.
config.core.consoleoverrides=If true, commands executed by the console can affect players that normally have an exempt permission against the command.
config.core.track=If true, if the server detects that a world UUID might have changed, Nucleus will whitelist the server and offer the chance to \
  revert the UUID change, if it detects methods that allow it to do so. You may to turn this off if you are deleting and recreating worlds.
config.core.worlduuidmigration=If you are having issues because a world UUID changed and you were unable to fix it, this allows you to redirect \
  old UUIDs to new ones (or world names). This is a map of old world UUIDs to new world names or new world UUIDs, the following are both valid:\n\n\
  "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"="world"\n\n\
  "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"="1b671a64-40d5-491e-99b0-da01ff1f3341"\n\n\
Other plugins will be able to check this map to perform their own migrations, support for that is up to those plugins.
config.core.wildcard=If true, if you log in and have the "wildcard" permission (either * or 'nucleus'), you will be warned of the potential issues \
  caused by the wildcard. If you use the wildcard and are happy with this, set this to false.
config.core.warning-on-startup=If true and no economy or permission plugin is detected, Nucleus will print a warning on startup. Set this to false \
  if you don't have one of these types of plugins and you're OK with that.
config.core.language=If set to "default", uses the default system language if it exists in Nucleus. If set to a language code, Nucleus will try to \
  use that as the default language. Nucleus is primarily written in "en-GB".\n\n\
  Community translation support is being explored. Please visit us on Discord to ask how you can help translate Nucleus into your own language.

config.core.datafilelocation=Specifies the path to save nucleus data files in. By default, files are saved at the root. Paths can be relative or absolute.\n\n\
  BE AWARE. Changing this location has the following caveats:\n\
  * This will only take effect after a restart.\n\
  * Files are NOT moved from the old location, you must do this yourself.\n\
  * Files will be in a "nucleus" subdireectory of your selected location.\n\
  * If the path indicated cannot be found, this will be ignored. It **must** exist beforehand.\n\
  * Minecraft data (as opposed to Nucleus data) is unaffected.\n\n\
  Common areas that you might want to put the data directory in are (using UNIX paths):\n\
  * "config/nucleus" for data in the Nucleus config data directory\n\
  * "world" for storing data in the primary world directory.\n\n\
  DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. Most admins do not need to move the data directory and should leave this option as "default".
config.core.offlineusertablimit=Determines the maximum number of offline user entries that are returned for Nucleus commands that allow offline \
  user targeting.
config.core.parentperms=If true, then the permissions "nucleus.owner", "nucleus.admin", "nucleus.mod" and "nucleus.user" can be used as permissions\
   to grant all suggested permissions for these levels. Note that:\n\n\
  * /nucleus setupperms will exist, but will be unnecessary for those using this permission structure\n\
  * Any specific permissions WILL override these permissions (so, setting `nucleus.home.base` to `false` should override `nucleus.user` being true \
  for that specific permission.\n\n\
  These permissions are designed to avoid the use of the wildcard. Some permissions are not given with these catch-alls, this is by design - the \
  permission to vanish on login (for example) must ALWAYS be given separately.

config.misc.speed.max=Sets the maximum speed that a player can set via the /speed command.

config.servershop.maxpurchasable=The maximum amount a player can buy in one transaction.

config.itemdatanode.aliases=A set of aliases that Nucleus recognises for this item. They all must be lowercase, and contain only letters, numbers, hyphens or underscores.

config.item.skullcompat=If true, Nucleus will simply treat /skull as an alias to '"/give [player] skull [number] 3 {SkullOwner:[skullplayer]}"'
config.item.repair.whitelist=If true, the restriction list will be used as a whitelist vs a blacklist.
config.item.repair.restrictions=The list of item types to prevent (or allow if whitelist is true) repairing using /repair

config.geoip.onlogin=If true, Nucleus will tell players with the "nucleus.geoip.login" permission the country the player is connecting via. Please be considerate with this permission, do not give it to everyone.

config.commandspy.template=The prefix to use when displaying the player''s command.
config.commandspy.usewhitelist=If true, command-filter acts as a whitelist of commands to spy on, else, it functions as a blacklist.
config.commandspy.filter=The blacklist (or whitelist if filter-is-whitelist is true) to use when determining which commands to spy on.

config.world.defaultborder=If positive, any new worlds that are created using "/world create" (or "/nworld create") will automatically get a world border that has this diameter (that is, from border to border). Set to 0 or a negative number to disable.
config.world.gen.warning=If true world generation will warn players on the server that a pre-generation is in progress periodically.
config.world.gen.each=If true, then players with the "nucleus.world.border.gen.notify" permission will get an update on progress after each \
  generation. Recommended to be off, because it can be VERY spammy.
config.world.gen.notify=Time, in seconds, between notifications in chat warning players a pre-gen is in progress.
config.worlds.separate=If true, changing worlds requires permission to access the target world - "nucleus.worlds.<worldname>"
config.worlds.gamemode=If true, joining or changing worlds will change the gamemode of a player unless they have the Minecraft permission \
  "nucleus.world.force-gamemode.override"

config.gamemode.separate=If true, then changing gamemode using the /gm command requires an extra permission to change to the target gamemode - "nucleus.gamemode.modes.<gamemode>"

config.protection.disablecrop=Disables crop trampling.
config.protection.mobgriefing.flag=If true, mob griefing will be disabled except for the entities listed in the whitelist (which should be done by mob ID).

config.vanish.connectionmessages=If true, players who leave or join the server under vanish will not have a login or logout message broadcast.
config.vanish.altertablist=[EXPERIMENTAL - use with caution] If true, Nucleus will try to alter the tab list when a player vanishes.

config.deathmessages.enable=If "false", death messages will be turned off when someone dies.
config.deathmessages.showall=If "true", Nucleus will try to make sure that everyone sees death messages.

afk.kickreason=You have been kicked for being AFK for too long.
